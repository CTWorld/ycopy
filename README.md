# Ycopy

[![npm version][npm-image]][npm-url]

## Installation

``` bash
yarn add ycopy
```

## Usage

``` bash
ycopy [src] [dest] [options] [-f] [file-filters] [-r] [folder-filters]
```

## Options

* `--version`: Show version number.
* `-o`, `--overwrite`: Overwrite existing file or directory, default is `true`. Note that the copy operation will silently fail if you set this to false and the destination exists. Use the errorOnExist option to change this behavior.
* `-e`, `--errorOnExist`: When overwrite is false and the destination exists, throw an error. Default is false.
* `-s`, `--dereference`: Dereference symlinks, default is false.
* `-t`, `--preserveTimestamps`: Will set last modification and access times to the ones of the original source files, default is false.
* `-f`, `--filter-file`: To filter copied files. If no filter is apply, all files will be reserved.
* `-r`, `--filter-folder`: To filter copied folders. If no filter is apply, all folders will be reserved.
* `-d`, `--delete`: Delete first before copy files. Default is false.
* `-i`, `--info`: Show more info. Default is false.
* `-h`, `--help`: Show help.

> Copy behaviors is similiar with [`fs-extra`](fs-extra)'s [`copy`](fs-extra-copy).

## Example

```` bash
ycopy test/a test/another/a -f .*.txt .*.jpg -r [^^c]$ -d
````

copy files and folders from test/a to test/another/a, which file is end with .txt or .jpg and folder is not containt character 'c'.

**For some reason, you need to replace `^^` with `^`, as the example above. When somehing are out of expect, you can check the param with option `-i`**
